This paper investigates the relationship between asset’s risk measure and climate change. We use VaR
model to stress the tail risk due to rare disaster brought by climate change. We use the Hodrick-Prescott
filter to remove the pro-cyclicality in the VaR model. Carbon emission is used as a proxy for climate
change effect, companies’ other fundamental financial indicators will also be included in regressors. We use
difference in difference approach to explore the influence of climate change related policy shocks such as
Paris Agreement and Stern Review. To study how climate change will affect financial asset’s risk measure,
we can optimize asset risk management and contribute to the study of risk related asset pricing.
