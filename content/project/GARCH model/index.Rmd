# Model Introduction

One fundamental assumptions for classic linear regression model is **homoskedasticity**, which mean the variance of the error term is constant. But with financial data, we often observe time-varying variance namely **heteroskedasticity**. We know that a GMM model would be more suitable in such case. This might be the first time for most students countering such a concept.

**GARCH model** (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity model) describes the variance of the current error term follows an **ARMA** model (Autoregressive Moving Average) instead of constant. 

$$y_t = x_t + \epsilon_t$$
$y_t$ is a stock return, $x_t$ is a mean reverting process, and $\epsilon_t$ is the error term. Usually $\epsilon_t \sim N(0, \delta_t)$ and $\delta_t$ is constant. But in GARCH model $\delta_t$ is time-varying and follow an ARMA process as follow:
$$\delta_t = \omega + \alpha_1 \epsilon^2_{t-1} + ... + \alpha_q \epsilon^2_{t-q} + \beta_1 \delta^2_{t-1} +...+ \beta_p \delta^2_{t-p}$$

## Use rugarch Package to Fit a GARCH Model{-}
The easy way to fit a GARCH model is using **rugarch** package through those two simple steps:

  1. Setting the model specification.
  2. Fit the model and get the parameters.

# Data Exploration
## Import Data
In this example I gonna use the Google stock data. It is downloaded through the **quantmod** package.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(quantmod)
googl <- getSymbols("GOOGL", from="2010-01-01", to="2022-08-03", auto.assign = F)
head(googl[, 1:5], 5)
```

Calculate daily return.
```{r}
daily_ret <- (googl$GOOGL.Close-stats::lag(googl$GOOGL.Close))/stats::lag(googl$GOOGL.Close)
```

Convet the data into data frame, and change the row and column names.
```{r}
daily_ret <- data.frame(index(daily_ret), daily_ret)
colnames(daily_ret) <- c("date", "return")
rownames(daily_ret) <- 1:nrow(daily_ret)
```

## Plot the Return
```{r, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
p1 <- ggplot(daily_ret, aes(x=date, y=return))
p1 + geom_line(colour="steelblue")
```

As it shows in the plot, the return of stock is not stationary. Approximately the mean is 0, but the volatility seems to be random. In the following, I will plot the histogram of the return and compare it with normal distribution. 

```{r, warning=FALSE}
p2 <- ggplot(daily_ret) 

p2 + geom_histogram(aes(x=return, y=..density..), binwidth = 0.005, color="steelblue", fill="grey", size=1) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = mean(daily_ret$return, na.rm = T), sd = sd(daily_ret$return, na.rm = T)), size=1)

```

**1. Skewness**

  As we can see from the plot the return is not symmetrically distributed, rather it is positive skewed (or right skewed). A positive skewness indicating on average it gives us a positive return. But the level of skewness is not very high. *p.s. If the distribution is highly right skewed we can use a log transformation to convert it into normal in avioding any misleading results.*

**2. Kurtosis**

  The plot show us positive Kurtosis comparing with normal distribution. Kurtosis can be used as a measure of risk. A large Kurtosis is associated with a high level of risk because it indicates that there are high probabilities of extremely large and small returns (**Heavy-tailed**). Meanwhile, a small kurtosis shows a moderate level of risk for the probabilities of extreme returns are relatively low. 

## Calculate the Monthly Volatility

Convert back the data frame to xts, then use `rollapply` to calculate rolling volatility.  For monthly rolling volatility I choose 20 trading days for one moth.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(PerformanceAnalytics)
library(xts)
daily_ret_xts <- xts(daily_ret[,-1], order.by=daily_ret[,1])
realizedvol <- rollapply(daily_ret_xts, width = 20, FUN=sd.annualized)
```

Convert back the xts data to dataframe.
```{r}
vol <- data.frame(index(realizedvol), realizedvol)
colnames(vol) <- c("date", "volatility")
```

Plot the monthly volatility.
```{r, warning=FALSE}
p3 <- ggplot(vol, aes(x=date, y=volatility))
p3 +
  geom_line( color="steelblue")
```

We can see that most of the time the volatility is around 0.25, while there are 4 times the volatility become very high. 

# Fit a GARCH Model 

## 1. Model Specification
Setting the model specification using the `ugarchspec` function.
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(rugarch)
garch_spec <- ugarchspec(variance.model=list(model="sGARCH", garchOrder=c(1,1)), mean.model=list(armaOrder=c(0,0)))
```

For the standard GARCH model, I specify a constant to mean ARMA model, which means that arma0rder = c(0,0). We consider the GARCH(1,1) model and the distribution of the conditional error term is the normal distribution.

## 2. Fit the Model
```{r}
fit_garch <- ugarchfit(spec = garch_spec, data = vol[-c(1:19),2])
fit_garch
```
