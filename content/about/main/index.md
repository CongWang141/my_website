  My research covers topics in the broad area of Macro-Finance, especially in Asset Pricing, Risk Management, Machine Learning, and Financial Econometrics.
  
  I Like documentary "Planet Earth", now "Our Planet" has better quality and the same [David Attenborough](https://attenboroughfilm.com/). Concern about climate change, try to quantify the risk in the financial market and real economy.
